## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player, vertical checkers game.

The players first choose a color (red or black) and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
